# ProjectThree
Team Name: DB

Project Name: Shortest Path Navigator

Proposal Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/194TKSuKCDL4QajRPDMVos2o027jjFwCGPn1CSFUNK3c/edit?ts=5f90b1a9

## Short Description:
With our application we aim to have a map that has a number of locations stored, the application will be able to return the path containing the shortest distance originating from a source node (home) to a certain location.
This application could be used by someone who would like to find the shortest path to his/her destination. This app has the benefits of saving time, and potentially fuel (if the person using the app is driving) through finding the shortest path to his/her destination.
